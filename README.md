The **app.py** file is the main backend script of the **Smartphone Addiction Prediction System**, developed using the Flask framework. It connects the user interface with pre-trained machine learning models to predict addiction levels. The application allows users to upload a dataset or manually enter behavioral details like screen time, app usage, and psychological attributes. It loads three trained models — Extra Tree, Stacking, and CatBoost — for prediction. Based on user input, the selected model analyzes data and predicts whether a person is addicted or not. The web app provides multiple routes for pages such as upload, preview, prediction, and result. It also supports visualizing performance using charts. The data entered by users is converted into a suitable format for model processing. Finally, the predicted results are displayed on a results page, giving clear insights into addiction risk levels. The app provides a simple, interactive, and data-driven approach for identifying smartphone addiction.
